# Sample Hardhat Project

This repo contains the deployment script for a reduced uniswap v4 contract. This was used at ETH Globaly NYC so that more people could use their v4 things on a testnet. 
The repo used yarn, so upon cloning, run yarn to add all packages. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
